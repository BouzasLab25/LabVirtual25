### Boilerplate & Theme differences

The boilerplate kit is better for more drastic hacking and changes, a project that's quite different to any other and needs a lot of custom work done. Additionally you'll only be able to use this method if you want to host it on GitHub Pages, as [themes can't be submitted](https://pages.github.com/themes/)... yet.

Using the theme will allow you to receive updates made and will be more programmatic. To make your own changes you'll need to overwrite the files with your own. For example: If I want to change the colours and typography of my site I'll need to copy the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file and create my own in `_sass/_settings.scss` with my own changes. This is the same for all files within the theme, which means your own project will be more lean than if you were to use the boilerplate.
